# MADIVoTEC Institute – Student Enrollment System

MADIVoTEC Institute is a student enrollment and course management web application built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This system allows students to register online and administrators to manage enrollments, courses, and student records efficiently.

This project was developed during my internship at MADIVoTEC Institute in Arusha, Tanzania, and demonstrates my backend development skills, database design, and full-stack web development knowledge.
